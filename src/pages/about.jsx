        We provide consumers with the option of drone delivery, which allows
        them to obtain their things in minutes. As a result, we offer
        contactless payments, allowing them to stay safe in the comfort of their
        own homes. Booking online appointments and meeting doctors who are both
        qualified and experienced has never been easier with MedX. Additionally,
        we provide lab tests to clients at their homes, helping them to monitor
        their health.
